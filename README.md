## Hey there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Aemadeous/Aemadeous** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as an Admin for EarthCubeMC and independently as a minecraft builder 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Axiom (minecraft building mod), french and philosophy
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything you believe might be relevant for me
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with minecraft building. I really want to improve my skills and i'd like a mentor
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything philosophical. It's my favourite kind of conversation
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: my discord is Hamilton#6069 username: Aemadeous
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him but if i like you enough, Teo is fine
- âš¡ Fun fact: Capitalism is not in fact unstoppable, and fascists are made of flesh and blood. You can totally just take a hammer to them.
